I am a forest biometrician based in Duluth, MN. My programming experience is primarily in R and python with a focus on processing geospatial data and statistical modeling.
I have been working for [SilviaTerra] since June 2016. My primary responsibilities in the organization include building statistical models to predict forest attributes using remotely sensed data sources, and developing tools for analysis of forest inventory data.
