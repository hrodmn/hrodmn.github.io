I am a forester and a programmer based in Duluth, MN. My programming experience is primarily in R and python with a focus on processing geospatial data and statistical modeling.
I have been working for [SilviaTerra] as a forest biometrician since June 2016. My primary activities in the organization include building models to predict forest attributes using remotely sensed data sources, and developing tools for analysis of forest inventory data.
